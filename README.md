# TLM-UAV-Anomaly-Detection-Dataset
This is a UAV anomaly detection dataset based on a software-in-the-loop simulation environment, and the dataset contains some of the anomaly logs of the UAV. 
Label 0 represents that the UAV is in a normal state; 
Label 1 represents that the GPS of the UAV has an anomaly; 
Label 2 represents that the accelerometer of the UAV has an anomaly; 
Label 3 represents that the engine of the UAV has an anomaly;
